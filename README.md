# SMSGateway
A rpi powered sms gateway with api to send a sms from any device like esp8266 or smartphone.
It comes with a easy to use Webinterface for configuring stuff.




# PARTS
* RPI Zero
* Sim800L GSM Module
* Activated SimCard
* USB2Serial (TTL)
* Wires
* PNP Transistor
* 3 leds
* 4 resistors

The system is designed to use multible gsm gateways to use sim cards from different providers.
So you habe two choises to handle multible gateways you can use a multiplexe to switch the TX,TX lines to the main Serial Port or you add a other USB2Serial adapter. 
I have used the USB2Serial adapter method because its simply to add, just modify a database table, this will go on the fly



# TOOLS
* soldering stuff
* sd card reader
* [OPTIONAL] 3d printer for case
